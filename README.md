# Learning Django
Here, I am learning how to use Django from a udemy course called Django 4 and Python Full-Stack Developer Masterclass.

I hate these kinds of courses but here I am, becoming a master from a masterclass. It goes over some HTML, CSS, python basics (which I skipped), and finally using Django.
